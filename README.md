# Student Performance Predictor

The **Student Performance Predictor** project uses machine learning to predict students' writing scores based on their math and reading scores. The project involves the use of **Linear Regression** for model building, followed by evaluation using various metrics and visualizations.

## Overview

In this project, we use a dataset of student's scores to predict writing scores using their math and reading scores. We perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The final trained model is saved for future use.

## Project Structure
